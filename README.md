# Exploring-Exoplanets
We analyzed the exoplanet data from the Kepler space mission to create data visualizations and interactive applications 
that relay the information presented by the data. The project is divided into different sections to enable a complete analysis of the data:


1. A Look into the Data - What type of Objects of Interest does the Data hold?
2. Cleaning the Data - Dealing with Infinite/NAN
3. Regressions - Learning more about the relationships between variables
4. Predicting - ML Portion (Logistic Regression, KNearest Neighbours,Decision Tree, Random Forest)
5. Interactive Application - Give us the specifics of your object of interest, let's see if it could be an exoplanet
6. Habitability of exoplanets - Can we leave earth for another home?
7. Interactive Application - So, where are you leaving to? Choose your exoplanet

One of the main reasons that drove this project is to contribute to science communication and to explore the data science driven side of
the Kepler space mission!
